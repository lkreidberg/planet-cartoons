Cartoons to show how transmission spectroscopy and thermal phase curves work (mp4s), plus the source code I used to make them.


The transmission spectroscopy cartoon shows how the atmosphere's opacity changes with wavelength (hight opacity corresponds to *larger* transit depth). The model spectrum is for a 100% water vapor atmosphere in the near IR (1.1 - 1.7 microns).

The phase curve cartoon shows the thermal emission of a planet over its entire orbital phase. The planet is tidally locked, so it has a hot dayside and a cold nightside, which are visible in turn as the planet orbits.
